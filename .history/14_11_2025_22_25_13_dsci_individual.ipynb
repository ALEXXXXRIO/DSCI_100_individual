    "This first bar graph illustrates the percentage of subscription rate of three different genders: male, female, and others within each experience category. Female players have the highest subscription rate, 40%, 39%, and 37.5% in regular, amateur, and veteran categories, respectively. It suggests that these three categories of females tend to subscribe to newsletters compared to other categories of females. 51% of the pro category’s subscribers are male players, and 49% are others. This suggests that the professional male players highly subscribe to it.  While approximately 45% of players who subscribe to the newsletter are others. Just beginner players have the highest rate, which other players subscribe to. In the veteran category, three types of gender equal proportion, 33%, subscribe to the newsletter.\n",

The model assumes independent observations, linearity of numeric predictors in the log-odds, and limited multicollinearity. Its main limitations include difficulty capturing non-linear relationships and sensitivity to class imbalance. I will split the dataset into 70% training and 30% testing, preprocess categorical and numeric variables, and apply 5-fold cross-validation on the training set."
